## Version 0.2.1 ##
- Improve newick serialization. It's much faster now and works on big trees.
- Because of how it is implemented, it now also works on preorder format `A(b, c)`, even though the standard form is `(b, c)A`.

## Version 0.2.0 ##
- Add `node.path.to`
- Remove `node.height()`. Tutorial shows alternative one-liner.
- Fix bug in post-order iteration
- Fix bug in `copy` and `deepcopy`
- Add support for serializing to and from [Newick format](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html)
